# scheduling-algorithms-implementation-using-QUEUE

This project demonstrates the implementation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms: Round Robin (RR), First Come First Serve (FCFS), and Shortest Job First (SJF). The visualization provides a better understanding of how these scheduling methods allocate CPU time to processes with different burst times.

Features
Round Robin (RR): Time-sharing scheduling where each process gets a fixed time slot in a cyclic order.
First Come First Serve (FCFS): Non-preemptive scheduling where the first process to arrive is the first to be served.
Shortest Job First (SJF): Scheduling where the process with the shortest burst time is given priority.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structuring the web page layout.
CSS: Styling and layout of the UI components.
JavaScript: Logic implementation for simulating the scheduling algorithms and handling user interactions.
Getting Started
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/margaretcs/scheduling-algorithms-implementation-using-data-structures.git)
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Usage
Add processes with burst times, select a scheduling algorithm, and click Run to see a visualization of how the algorithm schedules the processes.
Future Enhancements
Add more CPU scheduling algorithms.
Implement animations for process flow.
Adjust the time slice for Round Robin as needed.
